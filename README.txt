# How to Run

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
   python app.py

---

If you are using PyCharm, it will detect the requirements.txt file and may offer to create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages automatically. You can accept this for easier setup.
After creating the virtual environment, make sure to select the new virtual environment's Python interpreter in PyCharm's settings for the project to run correctly.
